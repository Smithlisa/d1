When the time comes to make a new hire - there is no silver bullet. Asking your employees and contacts to find your next rock star employee is cheaper and more efficient than paying $300-$400 to post in LinkedIn, Dice or Monster.
 
We want to introduce you to LytePole App. LytePole is born out of this pain.
 
LytePole helps you post jobs and broadcast it to your contacts for free. These contacts in turn can forward the job to their contacts until you find the right candidate.
 
Set a Referral Fee (if you choose to) and reward your employees and the network when you make a hire.
Note: The referral fee you post will be equally divided among all the people in the referral chain when you enable the referral payment and all this is magically handled by our algorithm.
 
Make it Public or Private and enable your contacts to post to their Social Media Profiles.
 
Inbuilt Messaging, Scheduling, Cloud document integration  and much more in a seamless App.
 
 
We want to invite a select few to our initial launch of our app. You can download the app at: https://www.lytepole.com
